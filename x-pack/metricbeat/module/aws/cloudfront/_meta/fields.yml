          description: >
            The amount of time (0-100) that the function took to run as a percentage of the maximum allowed time. For example, a value of 35 means that the function completed in 35% of the maximum allowed time.
        - name: BytesDownloaded.sum
          type: long
          description: >
            The total number of bytes downloaded by viewers for GET, HEAD, and OPTIONS requests.

          type: long
          description: >
            The number of validation errors produced by the function in a given time period. Validation errors occur when the function runs successfully but returns invalid data (an invalid event object).

          type: long
          description: >
            The number of execution errors that occurred in a given time period. Execution errors occur when the function fails to complete successfully.
